## Prerequisites

- [Visual C++ 2019 redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022)
  **(on Windows)**
- Python 3.7 or above (added to PATH)

> **_YouTube Music must be available in your country for spotDL to work. This is because we use
> YouTube Music to filter search results. You can check if YouTube Music is available in your
> country, by visiting [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com)._**

## Installation

Refer to our [Installation Guide](https://spotdl.rtfd.io/en/latest/installation/) for more
details

- Python (**Recommended**)
  - _spotDL_ can be installed by running `pip install spotdl`.
  > On some systems you might have to change `pip` to `pip3`.

### Other options

- Prebuilt Executable
  - You can download the latest version from the
    [Releases Tab](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/releases)
- On Termux
  - `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/master/scripts/termux.sh | sh`
- Arch
  - There is an Arch User Repository (AUR) package for
    [spotDL](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spotdl/).
- Docker
  - Build image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t spotdl .
    ```

  - Launch container with spotDL parameters (see section below). You need to create mapped
    volume to access song files

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/music spotdl download [trackUrl]
    ```

### Installing FFmpeg

If using FFmpeg only for spotDL, you can install FFmpeg to your local directory.
`spotdl --download-ffmpeg` will download FFmpeg to your spotDL installation directory.

We recommend the above option, but if you want to install FFmpeg system-wide,

- [Windows Tutorial](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)
- OSX - `brew install ffmpeg`
- Linux - `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or use your distro's package manager

## Usage

To get started right away:

```sh
spotdl download [urls]
```

To start the Web UI:

```sh
spotdl web
```

You can run _spotDL_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```sh
python -m spotdl [urls]
```
